### Simple app that show a list and detail of Vegan Recipes.

Build with __Kotlin__, applying **SOLID** principles and using the **Clean Architecture** approach.
I also implement the **Model View ViewModel** design pattern, which abstracts the user interactions from the business logic. Additionally, I used **coroutines** for Asynchronous tasks, **Retrofit** and **Okhttp3** to get data from http://spoonacular.com and **Material Components** for the "design" and user experience of the app.
